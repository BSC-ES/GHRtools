# Build Univariable Covariate Sets

## Description

This function returns a list where each element contains a single covariate, based on covariates specified in the `pattern` or `name` arguments. This structure is suitable for generating separate univariable model formulas using `write_inla_formulas`.

```r
cov_uni(covariates = NULL, pattern = NULL, name = NULL)
```

## Arguments

- `covariates`: A character vector of covariate names. Typically the output from `extract_names`.
- `pattern`: A character vector specifying the prefix pattern(s) to match (e.g., "tmin" matches "tmin", "tmin.l1", etc.).
- `name`: A character vector specifying exact variable name(s) to extract.

## Returns

A list of character vectors, each of length 1, containing the matched covariate name. The resulting list is suitable for use as the `covariates` argument in `write_inla_formulas`.

## Examples

```r
data <- data.frame(tmin = rnorm(10), tmin.l1 = rnorm(10), urban = rnorm(10))
covs <- extract_names(data, pattern = "tmin", name = "urban")
cov_uni(covs, pattern = "tmin")
cov_uni(covs, name = "urban")
```
